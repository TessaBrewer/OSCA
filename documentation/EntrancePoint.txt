Code execution starts with "Main.main(args)" From here we determine which interface we should 
be using
	In theory this should allow us to support both a GUI and a shell
We then pass everything to the "ExecutionManager" which will only interact with the interface 
through the abstract UI interface, Main handles the concrete implementation.
